# Analyzing_Reddit_trolls_using_machine_learning_and_networkscience (Complex Networks EE282V)
This is a big data analysis problem that we have solved using Random forests and network science. This project is developed as part of the network science course taught by Prof. Radu Marculescu at UT Austin. 

# Abstract
In recent years, malicious political players have used trolls to disperse misinformation and fake news across all social media platforms, including Reddit. Based on the Reddit
transparency report 2017, Russian trolls have been active during the 2016 US presidential elections. While trolls shape public opinion for various political discussions on Reddit, there is little understanding of how they operate and how their strategies evolve over time. This paper studies trollsâ€™ behavior across large political networks based on Reddit data. Our approach is two-fold; first, we build a random forest classifier that identifies active troll users in the r/politics subreddit. Second, we study the Russian trolls and the newly identified trolls for various network setups and perform both static and temporal analysis. Based on
our experiments, we reveal some interesting characteristics of these trolls.
